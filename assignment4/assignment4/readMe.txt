- I wouuld like to indicate that I have found 8 doubled URIs within the 1000 URIs callected. This is due to a bug in my code in assignment 2; I have fixed that. Now, all links are uneque.
- reference for extracting links throgh soup is from the online class lecture:
	for links in soup.find_all('a'): 
		print (links.get('href')) 	
		
	reference: 	http://www.cs.odu.edu/~mln/teaching/cs595-f13/?method=getElement&element=~week-02~week-02-python.pdf
	Thanks Hani.
